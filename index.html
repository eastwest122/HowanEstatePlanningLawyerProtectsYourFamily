        <h3>What Does a Probate Lawyer Actually Do?

</h3>
       
            <p>A probate lawyer (sometimes called an estate lawyer or probate attorney) helps settle a person’s estate after they pass away. Their main responsibilities include:
            </p>
            
            
                 <p><li><b>Validating the will in court  </b></li> </p>

               <p><li><b>Paying debts and taxes</b></li> </p>
            
             <p><li><b>Distributing property to heirs and beneficiaries</b></li> </p>

              <h2>Why You Need a Probate Lawyer in New York
</h2>
    
            <p>In New York State, probate is handled in the Surrogate’s Court of the county where the deceased lived — for residents of Flushing, that means the Queens County Surrogate’s Court.
            </p>
           
   
          
            <p>Avoid Court Confusion – Probate courts have strict rules and timelines. A lawyer ensures all filings are correct and on time.
            </p>
            
                 
            <p>Prevent Family Conflicts – Inheritance can bring out strong emotions. A neutral probate attorney keeps the process fair and transparent.
            </p>
            
             <p>Save Time & Stress – With a trusted estate planning attorney, you can focus on healing, while your lawyer manages the legal details.
            </p>
            
               <p>Protect Estate Assets – Skilled lawyers help reduce unnecessary taxes and fees, ensuring more of your assets go to your loved ones.
            </p>
